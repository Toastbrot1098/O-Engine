Hello, This is an Old Project that i wanted to start, but well, didnt have the programming bits in my head
If anybody is interested and has programming knowlege, can maybe help me make a working Prototype.
The OÂ² Engine was "Made" for making a simpler and an easy game called "Site 64".
It was supposed to be a game like SS13/SS14 (https://spacestation13.com/) Only Underwater!
